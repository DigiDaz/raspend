# Purpose

**cmdtest** is used for testing **raspend**'s command interface.

# Usage

The easiest way to use **cmdtest** is using Visual Studio Code with the Debugger for Chrome extension and the Chrome browser itself installed. Otherwise you need an web server installation like Apache or NGINX to run it.
If your **raspend** based HTTP web service is listening on another port than **8080** you will need to change the port used in app.js.

**cmdtest** uses bootstrap css, license is included in the licenses folder.

Have fun!
