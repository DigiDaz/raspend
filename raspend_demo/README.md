# Purpose

**raspend_demo** is used for testing **raspend**'s publishing module.

# Usage

The easiest way to use **raspend_demo** is using Visual Studio Code with the PHP Debug extension installed (that's what I did). Then you need a web server with PHP enabled (I use [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)). To use the PHP Debug extension you further need to enable XDebug. See [PHP Debug extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felixfbecker.php-debug) for more information and follow the installations steps.
